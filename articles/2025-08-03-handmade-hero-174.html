  <p class="lead">Today we're tackling the complex world of Unicode. Instead of supporting the entire specification, we'll focus on a "sparse" implementation that covers the most common use cases for game development text rendering.</p>

  <h2>The Problem with Unicode</h2>
  <p>Full Unicode support is a massive undertaking, involving complex rules for combining characters, bidirectionality, and more. For many games, this is overkill. We only need to render text from a limited set of languages.</p>

  <h2>A Simpler Approach</h2>
  <p>Our approach will be to pre-process our font assets to contain only the glyphs we need. We'll map UTF-8 input to our internal glyph indices. This keeps the runtime code simple and fast.</p>
  
  <pre><code class="lang-c">
typedef struct {
    uint32_t codepoint;
    // ... other glyph data
} glyph_info;

void DrawText(char *text) {
    // 1. Decode UTF-8 string to codepoints
    // 2. Look up codepoint in our sparse glyph map
    // 3. Render the corresponding glyph
}
  </code></pre>
