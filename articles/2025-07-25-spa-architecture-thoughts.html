  <p class="lead">This blog itself is an experiment in minimalist single-page application design. By avoiding large frameworks, we gain complete control, reduce dependencies, and achieve maximum performance for this specific use case.</p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Single File:</strong> HTML, CSS, and JS are all in `index.html`. This simplifies deployment to any static host.</li>
      <li><strong>Static Content:</strong> Articles are separate HTML files, not database entries. This makes them easy to edit and version control.</li>
      <li><strong>Vanilla JS:</strong> No React, Vue, or Angular. We manipulate the DOM directly, which is perfectly fine for an application with simple state transitions.</li>
      <li><strong>State Management:</strong> A single, simple JavaScript object holds the entire application state (the list of articles, sort order, etc.). Rendering functions are called when the state changes.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <pre><code class="lang-c">
// The "framework" is just a few functions:
function render() {
    // Update DOM based on `state` object
}

function handleEvent() {
    // Mutate `state` object
    // Call render()
}
  </code></pre>
  
  <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
  <p>This approach would not scale to a large, multi-person project. The lack of a component model or declarative rendering would become a bottleneck. But for a personal site, it's a joy to work withâ€”fast, transparent, and with zero bloat.</p>
